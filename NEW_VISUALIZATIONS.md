- ✅ Plan monitoring schedules around high-risk periods
- ✅ Detect time-zone based attack patterns

**How to read it:**
- **Darker red** = More attacks at that time

- Top 10 domains by number of phishing attempts
- Color gradient shows relative attack volume

**Insights you can gain:**
- ✅ Identify which specific domains are being targeted most
- ✅ Prioritize defense efforts on high-risk domains
- ✅ Track brand-specific targeting patterns
- ✅ Monitor domain reputation

**How to read it:**
- Longer bars = More attacks on that domain
- Bars sorted from highest to lowest
- Hover to see exact attack counts

---

### 3. **Attack Type Distribution (Donut Chart)** 🥧
**Location:** Row 4, Left Panel

**What it shows:**
- Percentage breakdown of all attack types
- Clear visual proportions with legend
- Donut (ring) chart for modern aesthetics

**Attack types tracked:**
- Fake Login Pages
- Malicious Links
- Survey/Prize Scams
- Invoice/Payment Fraud
- Package Delivery Scams

- ✅ Identify emerging attack trends

**How to read it:**
- Slice size = Percentage of total attacks
- Hover to see exact counts and percentages
- Legend shows all attack types

---

### 4. **URL Length Distribution** 📏
**Location:** Row 4, Right Panel

**What it shows:**
- Histogram of phishing URL character lengths
- Distribution across 30 bins
- Average URL length marked with red dashed line

**Insights you can gain:**
- ✅ Identify suspicious URL length patterns
- ✅ Detect unusually long/short phishing URLs
- ✅ Set URL length-based detection rules
- ✅ Understand typical phishing URL structure

**How to read it:**
- X-axis = URL length in characters
- Y-axis = Number of URLs at that length
- Red line = Average length
- Clusters indicate common phishing patterns

## 🔍 How Filters Affect New Visualizations

**All 4 new charts respond to filters:**

### Example 1: Time Range Filter
- **Filter:** Last 24 Hours
- **Heatmap:** Shows only attacks from past 24 hours
- **Top Domains:** Updates to domains attacked in last 24h
- **Pie Chart:** Recalculates percentages for filtered data
- **Histogram:** Adjusts URL length distribution

### Example 2: Brand Filter
- **Filter:** PayPal
- **Heatmap:** Shows when PayPal attacks occur
- **Top Domains:** Domains impersonating PayPal
- **Pie Chart:** Attack types used against PayPal
- **Histogram:** URL lengths for PayPal phishing

### Example 3: Combined Filters
- **Filters:** Last 7 Days + Fake Login Page + Russia
- **Result:** All 7 visualizations show only Russian fake login page attacks from the past week
