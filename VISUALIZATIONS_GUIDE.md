### **Typical Distribution**:
```
Length Range    | Frequency | Type
----------------|-----------|------------------
0-30 chars      | Low       | Rare, suspicious
31-50 chars     | Medium    | Short domains
51-80 chars     | HIGH      | Most common (PEAK)
81-120 chars    | Medium    | Long domains
121-200 chars   | Low       | Very long URLs
200+ chars      | Very Low  | Extremely long
```

### **Key Insights**:

#### **Why URL Length Matters**:

1. **Legitimate URLs (typically shorter)**:
   - `https://paypal.com` (19 chars)
   - `https://microsoft.com` (22 chars)
   - `https://bankofamerica.com/login` (35 chars)

2. **Phishing URLs (typically longer)**:
   - `https://paypal-verify-account-security.malicious.com/login.php?ref=update` (75 chars)
   - `https://microsoft-account-verify.phishing-site.net/security/confirm.asp` (74 chars)
   - Reason: Attackers add keywords to make URLs look legitimate

3. **Why Phishing URLs Are Longer**:
   - ➕ **Keyword Stuffing**: "verify", "secure", "account", "login"
   - ➕ **Subdomain Tricks**: "paypal-security.evil.com"
   - ➕ **Path Manipulation**: "/account/verify/security/confirm"
   - ➕ **Query Parameters**: "?ref=secure&action=verify&user=email"
   - ➕ **Obfuscation**: Random characters to avoid detection

### **Anomaly Detection**:

- **⚠️ Too Short (< 30 chars)**: 
  - Might be URL shorteners (bit.ly)
  - Could hide true destination
  - Often used in SMS phishing

- **✅ Normal Range (50-100 chars)**:
  - Most phishing URLs fall here
  - Balance between legitimacy and keywords
  - Sweet spot for social engineering

- **⚠️ Too Long (> 150 chars)**:
  - Potential parameter injection
  - Session hijacking attempts
  - Complex redirect chains

### **Filter Effects**:
- **Attack Type**: Different attacks have different length profiles
  - *Fake login pages*: Medium length (70-90 chars)
  - *Prize scams*: Longer (100+ chars with tracking params)
- **Brand**: Different brands have different typical lengths
  - *Banks*: Longer due to security paths
  - *Social media*: Shorter domains

### **Security Applications**:
1. **URL Filtering**: Flag URLs outside normal ranges
2. **Machine Learning**: Length as a feature for classification
3. **User Warnings**: Alert on suspiciously long URLs
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify URL structure anomalies

### **Real-World Example**:
```
Legitimate: https://paypal.com/login
            (26 characters)

Phishing:   https://paypal-secure-verify.account-update.suspicious-domain.com/verify.php?user=victim@email.com
            (114 characters)
```

**Key Differences**:
- Phishing URL is 4x longer
- Contains multiple keywords
- Has suspicious subdomain structure
- Includes query parameters
