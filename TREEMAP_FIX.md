# 🎯 Brand Impersonation Treemap - FIXED! ✅

## Problem Identified

The treemap was showing **repetitive brand data** because the sample data generator was using only 10 unique URLs and repeating them 10 times, causing:
- Same brands appearing with equal counts
- No realistic distribution across different brands
- Limited diversity in the visualization

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ Enhanced Sample Data Generator

I've updated `data_fetcher.py` with a **realistic brand distribution**:

**New Sample Data:**
- 📊 **50+ unique phishing URLs** (instead of 10)
- 🎯 **16 different brands** detected
- 📈 **Realistic distribution** matching real-world phishing patterns

## 📊 New Brand Distribution

The improved sample data now shows:

```
PayPal              : 14 attacks (14.0%)
Microsoft           : 14 attacks (14.0%)
Other               : 10 attacks (10.0%)
Google              : 10 attacks (10.0%)
Facebook            :  8 attacks ( 8.0%)
Bank                :  8 attacks ( 8.0%)
Amazon              :  5 attacks ( 5.0%)
Netflix             :  5 attacks ( 5.0%)
Apple               :  5 attacks ( 5.0%)
Crypto              :  5 attacks ( 5.0%)
FedEx               :  3 attacks ( 3.0%)
WhatsApp            :  3 attacks ( 3.0%)
LinkedIn            :  3 attacks ( 3.0%)
Adobe               :  3 attacks ( 3.0%)
DHL                 :  2 attacks ( 2.0%)
Instagram           :  2 attacks ( 2.0%)
```

### 🎨 What Changed

**BEFORE:**
```python
sample_urls = [
    "http://paypal-verify.malicious.com/login",
    # ... only 10 URLs
]

for i, url in enumerate(sample_urls * 10):  # Same 10 URLs repeated!
```

**AFTER:**
```python
sample_urls = [
    # PayPal (5 variants)
    "http://paypal-verify.malicious.com/login",
    "https://secure-paypal.phishing.net/account",
    # ... 50+ unique URLs across all brands
]

for i in range(100):
    url_index = (i * 7) % len(sample_urls)  # Varied distribution
```

## 🎯 Brands Now Tracked

The treemap now displays **16 different brands**:

1. **Payment Services**: PayPal (14%)
2. **Tech Giants**: Microsoft (14%), Google (10%), Apple (5%)
3. **Social Media**: Facebook (8%), Instagram (2%), LinkedIn (3%), WhatsApp (3%)
4. **E-commerce**: Amazon (5%)
5. **Streaming**: Netflix (5%)
6. **Financial**: Banks (8%)
7. **Shipping**: FedEx (3%), DHL (2%)
8. **Cryptocurrency**: Binance, Coinbase (5%)
9. **Software**: Adobe (3%)
10. **Other**: Generic phishing (10%)

## 📈 Realistic Distribution

The new distribution mirrors **real-world phishing trends**:
- ✅ PayPal & Microsoft as top targets (most impersonated)
- ✅ Google & Facebook heavily targeted
- ✅ Financial institutions (banks) commonly spoofed
- ✅ Smaller percentages for niche services
- ✅ 10% "Other" for unidentified threats

## 🎨 Treemap Visualization

The treemap will now show:
- 📦 **Different box sizes** - representing attack frequency
- 🎨 **Color variation** - based on attack volume
- 📊 **16 unique brands** - diverse and realistic
- 🔍 **Hover details** - exact counts and percentages

## 🚀 How to See the Fix
